\title{Compute distances from occurrence and background points to multiple habitats}
\usage{
compute_all_distances_generic(occ_sf, bg_sf, habitats)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ_sf}{sf POINT, occurrence locations.}

\item{bg_sf}{sf POINT, background locations.}

\item{habitats}{Named list of sf objects, e.g.
\code{list(roads = roads_sf, rivers = rivers_sf)}.}
}
\value{
list with two data.frames:
\itemize{
\item \code{occ}: columns are habitats, rows are occurrence points;
\item \code{bg}:  columns are habitats, rows are background points.
}
}
\description{
Given occurrence points, background points, and a named list of habitat
features, compute the minimum distance from each point to each habitat.
