\title{Compare multiple decay models using AIC}
\usage{
compare_models_AIC(distance, frequency)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{Numeric vector of distances.}

\item{frequency}{Numeric vector of frequencies.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{details}: a named list of model fit results.
\item \code{AIC_table}: a data.frame with columns \code{model} and \code{AIC},
sorted by AIC (ascending).
\item \code{best_model}: character string with the name of the model
that has the lowest AIC.
}
Returns \code{NULL} if no model could be fitted.
}
\description{
Fit several candidate models (exponential, linear, power-law, Gaussian)
to the same distance–frequency data and compare them using the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC).
