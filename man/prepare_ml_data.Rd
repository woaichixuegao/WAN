\title{Prepare machine-learning input data (point-based)}
\usage{
prepare_ml_data(dist_occ, dist_bg, env_occ = NULL, env_bg = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist_occ}{A data.frame of distances from occurrence points to
multiple habitats (one column per habitat).}

\item{dist_bg}{A data.frame of distances from background points to
multiple habitats.}

\item{env_occ}{Optional data.frame of environmental variables for
occurrence points (must have the same number of rows as \code{dist_occ}).
Examples: mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP).}

\item{env_bg}{Optional data.frame of environmental variables for
background points (same number of rows as \code{dist_bg}).}
}
\value{
A combined data.frame with a \code{presence} column and all
predictor variables.
}
\description{
Combine occurrence and background distances to multiple habitats (and
optionally environmental variables) into a single \code{data.frame}
suitable for machine-learning models such as Random Forest.

The output contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{presence = 1} for occurrence points,
\item \code{presence = 0} for background points.
}
}
