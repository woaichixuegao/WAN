\title{Read a habitat–distance frequency table (e.g., a.csv)}
\usage{
read_habitat_data(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Character string. Path to the CSV file (e.g., "a.csv").}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing standardized columns:
distance,
sampling_roads, occurrence_roads,
sampling_sand, occurrence_sand,
sampling_rivers, occurrence_rivers,
sampling_stations, occurrence_stations.
}
\description{
Read a formatted CSV file containing distance–frequency information for
sampling points and occurrence points with respect to multiple habitat
types. The function renames verbose column names in the input file to the
concise internal naming convention used by the WAN package.

The input file must contain:
\itemize{
\item a distance column
\item paired frequency columns for sampling and occurrence for each habitat
}

These will be renamed into:
distance, sampling_\if{html}{\out{<habitat>}}, occurrence_\if{html}{\out{<habitat>}}
}
